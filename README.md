# MilkDrop 3 - Linux Port

This is a fork of the original Nullsoft MilkDrop 3 visualizer, with the goal of porting it from its original Windows/DirectX architecture to a modern, cross-platform C++ application that runs on Linux using OpenGL.

## Original Authors

The original MilkDrop codebase was created by Nullsoft. All credit for the original visualization engine and algorithms goes to them.

This project is based on the portable version by MilkDrop2077 (https://x.com/MilkDrop2077) which is forked from BeatDrop (https://github.com/OfficialIncubo/BeatDrop-Music-Visualizer)
